	<h1>Prometheus SSL validation with OCSP support and dynamic alerts</h1>
	You can find the repository at the following url <a
		href="https://github.com/aleusai/ssl-certs-validator">https://github.com/aleusai/ssl-certs-validator</a>
	<h2>Use case/Motivation</h2>

	<p>
		The validator is an ssl certificate verification service which exposes several restful api endpoints to verify
		a particular url and its ssl certificate chain ( in a broad sense).
		It is also a wrapper of the widely used Prometheus Blackbox exporter, and is itself also a Prometheus exporter
		as it re-exports the (modified with OCSP support) Blackbox metrics. Furthermore it can handle dynamic alerts 
		(i.e. targets not mentioned in the prometheus server configuration file) using the Prometheus Pushgateway server in 
		push mode. All the components in the repository are installed in Docker containers.
