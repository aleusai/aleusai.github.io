	<h1>Prometheus SSL validation with OCSP support and dynamic alerts</h1>
	You can find the repository at the following url <a
		href="https://github.com/aleusai/ssl-certs-validator">https://github.com/aleusai/ssl-certs-validator</a>
	<h2>Use case/Motivation</h2>

	<p>
		The validator is an ssl certificate verification service which exposes several restful api endpoints to verify
		a particular url and its ssl certificate chain ( in a broad sense).
		It is also a wrapper of the widely used Prometheus Blackbox exporter, and is itself also a Prometheus exporter
		as it re-exports the (modified with OCSP support) Blackbox metrics. Furthermore it can handle dynamic alerts 
		(i.e. targets not mentioned in the prometheus server configuration file) using the Prometheus Pushgateway server in 
		push mode. All the components in the repository are installed in Docker containers.

	<h1> Cytoscape Tree Editor</h1>
	You can find the repository at the following url <a href="https://github.com/aleusai/cytoscape-tree-editor">https://github.com/aleusai/cytoscape-tree-editor</a>
	<h2>Use case/Motivation</h2>
	<p>
		The Editor allows the creation of a Cytoscape Tree with different node types, each node having a different data payload. 
		A Tree can be created, uploaded, saved, as well as edited (e.g. cloning/deleting nodes, or editing the data payload themselves). 
		Many actions are done with specific key bindings while the data editing is done with Ace editors in-browser. There is also a pipeline 
		editor that allows the creation of multiple branches by simply specifyng the node type. Each Tree is thought of as a root node, with is 
		connected to meta nodes (one per node type): these latter ones in turn are conneccted to 1...n nodes of that specific type. 
		A use case for this type of visualization is the representation of a two level json configuration file.
		As Cytoscape is used in headless mode, thousands of nodes can be handled at the same time (depending on the hardware, possibly tens 
		of thousands).
